        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello I am Esther Kwon and my pronouns are she/hers. I am currently a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. As of right now, I am part of the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS) Undeclared Program. I am exploring courses and majors that best align with my interests, values, and personal goals. I am considering Computer Science and/or Economics in Administrative Studies as a major.  I graduated from Cerritos High School in June 2021.  <br><br>

        Throughout my highschool career, I involved myself in volunteer services and a plethora of extracurricular activities. I was the Vice President of Resilience Amongst Youth (RAY) Club in Brea, CA from May 2019 through March 2021; I collaborated with Crittenton Services, a local child advocacy and mental health non-profit organization. I worked closely with the children as well as the staff to organize events and meetings with fellow leaders of local branches. Additionally, tactfully planned arts and craft activities for child patients and during the COVID-19 pandemic, I fundraised medical supplies. Furthermore, I was an active Civil Air Patrol (CAP), the Auxiliary of the United States Air Force, member. During my 4 years, I gradually moved up to the position of a Flight Commander. As a leader, I organized and coordinated numerous volunteer events and classes. I trained new sergeants and incoming cadets on the transition between followership and leadership. Within that program, I participated in Cyber Patriot. As I learned about Windows cybersecurity, I also instructed students on basic fundamentals of Windows security procedures and expanded cyber security knowledge and maneuverability. I participated in CyberPatriot 10, 11, 12, and 13. Out of the 3 times as a National Finalist, I was a National Winner coming in first in the Cisco NetAcad Challenge and third in All Services. For both Civil Air Patrol and Cyber Patriot, I was present from September 2016 to August 2021 in Fullerton and Anaheim, California. Moreover, I was an online listener on the application 7 Cups which is a website that provides online therapy and free support for individuals experiencing emotional distress by connecting them with trained listeners. Although I was only a listener from July 2020 to September 2020, I acquired active listening skills and professionalism in dealing with sensitive issues. Lastly, I acquired foundation studio art from Ryman Arts at Cal State Fullerton in 2018-2019. During my time at Ryman Arts, I networked other artists and gained valuable knowledge regarding art education. I also volunteered at Big Draw LA in 2019 where I assisted and helped regulate the event with staff. This is a festival that brings families, art lovers, and seniors, and everyone to participate in hands-on drawing activities at the park.<br><br>

        Awards Iâ€™ve acquired is Congressional Gold Medal Award (2021), Cyber Patriot 13 National Finalist (2021), JAWS Dragon Boat Captainâ€™s Award (2020), Future Leaders of America (2019), Congressional Silver Medal Award (2019), Congressional Bronze Medal Award (2019), CyberPatriot 11 National Finalist (2019), CyberPatriot 10 National Finalist (2018).
